## 🔧 Currently Working On

- 🧠 **Full-Stack Research Developer**  
I'm working on full-stack systems that power internal research platforms. My current focus is on building efficient REST APIs in Node.js, writing scalable React interfaces, and embedding user analytics via Matomo. I also optimize SQL queries to enhance database performance and enforce clean, testable code through CI pipelines and unit testing.

- 📍 **Biomedical Motion Capture Analysis**  
I'm also part of an exciting research initiative using **Qualisys motion capture systems** and Python to analyze biomechanical data (marker points, joint angles, etc.) for medical applications. This role involves integrating **sensor data**, exploring **signal processing**, and potentially applying **computer vision** techniques on recorded motion data for enhanced insight into human movement.

## 🧪 Previous Work

- 🩺 **AI Researcher – Medical Image Segmentation**  
As part of a medical imaging research team, I developed deep learning models (UNET) using the MONAI framework to segment heart substructures in 3D MRI data. I explored **SAM 2 (Segment Anything Model)** from Meta (LLaMA) to test its utility in diagnostics, annotated data using **ITK-Snap**, and trained models with high Dice coefficient performance. This project was a deep dive into applied **computer vision in healthcare**.
